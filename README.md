# Evernote Recipes
## Life story
### The Elephant 
I love using [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). A few months ago I notice that the bulk of my notes were recipes I had collected over the years. I had spent a good deal of time tagging them, fixing the formatting, add images, and just making them look good.

Even with all that work, I never found myself checking Evernote when it came time to start cooking. The standard Evernote interface is great for a wide range of notes but doesn't fit perfectly for recipes.

### The Pretty One
I love browsing [FoodGawker](http://foodgawker.com/). The interface is simple, just a bunch amazing food pictures. I could spend hours looking through the new recipes it didn't seem like a great place to store and retrieve my favorites.

### An App is Born
Eventually I had the bright idea of combining the two! If I could leverage the elephant like memory of Evernote and create an interface that encouraged browsing through recipes like FoodGawker, I could make billions!

### Better Late Than Never
Sadly I wasn't the only one with this idea. A few weeks later Evernote released an update to their amazing app [Evernote Food](http://evernote.com/food/) that did exactly what I wanted. Easy to browse, pretty to look at, mixes in other's recipes with mine, and even lets me track where I've eaten.

Instead of giving up though, I decided to make Evernote Recipes. Maybe I won't make the billions that I could have before but at least I get a chance to hone my programming skills.
 
## This is only a test
This app was built just as an excuse for me to play around with the Evernote API. I have no intention of making a real live consumer web app out of it. There isn't a lot of code in here at the moment but the app covers a few things that were tricky to get right at first. If you need a reference for how to authenticate with the Evernote API, what a testing environment could look like, or just love looking at Ruby code, you might find something in this project useful.
 
## Want to help?
If you have any suggestions, want to see something added, or want to fork the project and play on your own, feel free! This is all just for fun anyway.
